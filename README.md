# Cipher
Garrick Wong 2024

This is a python application that is supposed to act as a ceasar cipher. I created this project for fun and for practice.
I used wxPython to create a GUI following a guide on Real Python

The GUI works, but requires work before it is completely operational. The functionality of the GUI current allows the input of the input letters and the input message. The encoded message will output to the console. In future updates the encoded message will show in a dialog box.

Run the program using gui.py. The program will terminate if the X button is clicked.
